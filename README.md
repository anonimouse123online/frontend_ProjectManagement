Project Management App

Thesis Project – BSIT

📌 Overview

This Project Management App is developed as part of my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) thesis. The goal of this project is to design and implement a digital project and task management system that improves workflow coordination, task tracking, and on-site reporting, especially for construction and field-based projects.

The application focuses on organizing tasks, monitoring progress, and providing a structured workflow that reflects real-world project operations.

🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

To create a centralized platform for managing projects and tasks

To provide a clear workflow from planning to validation

To reduce manual tracking and paper-based reporting

To simulate an actual project management process used in real sites

To design a system that is scalable for future backend integration

🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is developed using the following technologies:

React Native (Expo) – for cross-platform mobile development

JavaScript / TypeScript – application logic

Expo Router – navigation and screen management

Figma – UI/UX design and prototyping

Local Storage (temporary) – for offline and testing purposes

⚠️ Note: The current version uses local data. The system is designed to be connected to a backend (API + database) in future enhancements.

⚙️ System Features

📂 Project creation and overview

📝 Task listing and task details

⏱️ Task status and progress tracking

📅 Scheduling and timeline visibility

👷 Role-based workflow (Admin / Field User concept)

📱 Mobile-friendly and offline-capable design

🔄 Project Workflow

The system follows a structured operational workflow:

Planning & Initialization

Project is created by the Project Manager

Scope, timeline, and tasks are defined

Task Distribution

Tasks are assigned to field users

Each task contains detailed information

Execution

Field users perform assigned tasks

Task status is updated based on progress

Validation & Monitoring

Completed tasks are reviewed

Project progress is monitored in real time

👨‍💻 Development Process (How I Worked on It)

I developed this project by following a step-by-step and iterative approach:

I started by analyzing real project workflows, especially in construction and site management

I designed the system structure and workflow based on actual operational processes

I created UI/UX prototypes using Figma before coding

I implemented the frontend using React Native with Expo

I used modular components to make the system clean and scalable

I focused on clarity, usability, and real-world applicability rather than just technical complexity

The project was continuously improved through testing, revisions, and feedback to ensure it aligns with the thesis objectives.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for future versions include:

Backend integration (Node.js / Firebase / SQL)

Real-time synchronization

User authentication and role management

Cloud storage for reports and images

Analytics and project performance dashboards

🎓 Academic Purpose

This application is developed strictly for academic and research purposes as part of my undergraduate thesis requirement. It demonstrates my skills in:

Mobile application development

System analysis and design

Project workflow modeling

UI/UX design

Software engineering principles
